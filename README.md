## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! This is where I share the projects I'm working on, ranging from academic assignments to personal experiments and side projects. You'll find a variety of work, from hardware design and circuit simulations to software development, all of which contribute to my growth as an engineer.

I'm an Electronics and Electrical Engineering (EEE) student with a primary focus on the **electronic** side of the field. My passion lies in designing and building circuits, programming microcontrollers, working with embedded systems, and exploring the world of electronic devices. While I am well-versed in electrical engineering principles, my true excitement comes from diving into electronics.

I do tend to keep my practice repositories and projects privateâ€”sometimes you just need space to experiment without pressure! ðŸ˜… But as I continue learning, you'll see more polished projects making their way here.

### Current Projects
- **Haptic Navigation Assistant:** Work in progress â€” will be released once the first functional version is complete. 

### ðŸ”§ Technologies & Tools I Use
- **Microcontrollers:** Atmega328P, ESP32, STM32
- **Programming Languages:** C, C++, Python
- **Design Tools:** KiCad, Altium Designer, LTSpice, SolidWorks, 
- **Embedded Systems:** AVR, Xtensa 
- **Simulation Tools:** Multisim

### ðŸŒ± Current Learning Focus
